# Electroverse Electronics Shop

Welcome to the README for Electroverse! This document provides an overview of the final project I am currently working on as part of my studies as a full-stack developer at Brightcode.

## Project Description

Electroverse is an online shop for electronics enthusiasts, designed to provide a seamless shopping experience. Here are some of the key features and functionalities of the project:

- **Product Browsing**: Users can browse and search for a wide range of electronics products.

- **Sorting and Filtering**: Users can sort and filter products to find what they're looking for more easily.

- **Wish List**: Users can add products to their wish list for future reference or purchase.

- **Comments and Ratings**: Users can write comments and provide ratings for products they have purchased.

- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in to their accounts to access personalized features and keep track of their activity.

- **Account Management**: Users can manage their account settings, including profile information and password changes.

- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to their shopping cart for easy checkout.

- **Ordering**: Users can place orders, select from saved addresses, add new addresses, and choose payment and pickup options.

- **Upcoming Features**: The project has more exciting features in development, making it an evolving platform for electronics shoppers.

## Project Structure

The Electroverse project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Frontend**: This is the client-facing part of the project, where users interact with the website. The frontend code can be found in the repository where this README is located.

2. **Backend**: The backend of Electroverse is implemented in a separate repository called "electronics-shop-server," maintained by me. It handles server-side logic, data storage, and communication between the frontend and the server.

## Conclusion

Electroverse Electronics Shop is not just a project; it's a culmination of my journey as a full-stack developer at Brightcode. With a wide array of features and functionalities, I hope that this project showcases my skills and dedication to creating a user-friendly and dynamic web application.

Thank you for choosing Electroverse!
